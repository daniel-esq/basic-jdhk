Basic Spring Boot java REST CRUD application implemented for the sole purpose
of proving docker and kubernetes configuration.

####Requirements
   - Java JDK 1.8 - [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk8-downloads.html)
   - Maven - [here](http://maven.apache.org/install.html)


####Environment variables
In order to prove how environment variables are passed to the application the file
`local/dev.env` contains an example that can be used when the application is ran locally.

####Running the application locally
There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. 
That can be via your favourite IDE passing the local environment variables or  
using the above command in the terminal:
~~~
 mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.arguments=--RUNNING_ENVIRONMENT=Terminal
~~~

####Dockerfile
The Dockerfile is a starting point when dockerizing your applications, 
and it contains the operations needed to create a Docker image.
Actions happening during the creation of the image:
 - copy the jar generated generated by the `mvn package` command
 - copy the docker-entrypoint.sh 
 - give execute permissions
 - set entrypoint which is the script executed when the container is started
 - expose the port where the application is running
